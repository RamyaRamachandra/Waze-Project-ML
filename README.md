# Waze-Project-ML

#### The nuts and bolts of machine learning

Your team is close to completing their user churn project. Previously, you completed a project proposal, and used Python to explore and analyze Waze’s user data, create data visualizations, and conduct a hypothesis test. Most recently, you built a binomial logistic regression model based on multiple variables.

Leadership appreciates all your hard work. Now, they want your team to build a machine learning model to predict user churn. To get the best results, your team decides to build and test two tree-based models: random forest and XGBoost.

Your work will help leadership make informed business decisions to prevent user churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.

#### Course 6 End-of-Course Project: Build a machine learning model
In this activity, you will practice using tree-based modeling techniques to predict on a binary target class.


**The purpose** of this model is to find factors that drive user churn.

**The goal** of this model is to predict whether or not a Waze user is retained or churned.


This activity has three parts:

**Part 1**: Ethical considerations

* Consider the ethical implications of the request

* Should the objective of the model be adjusted?

**Part 2**: Feature engineering

* Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling
**Part 3**: Modeling

* Build the models, evaluate them, and advise on next steps
Follow the instructions and answer the questions below to complete the activity. Then, you will complete an Executive Summary using the questions listed on the PACE Strategy Document.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.
